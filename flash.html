							<h2><center>THE FLASH</center></h2>

						<p>Everyone knows that The Flash can run really fast. There’s a reason that his nickname is the Scarlet Speedster. But what a lot of people don’t know is that super speed isn’t The Flash’s only superpower. His connection to the Speed Force gives him plenty of abilities, making him one of the most interesting, and dangerous heroes in the DC Universe. The speed force gives the user such additional gifts as superhuman endurance, an accelerated metabolism and a decelerated aging process, as well as increased reaction speed and enhanced strength. One of the most interesting things that comes from all of this, combined with his super speed, is the ability to create the 'infinite mass punch.' It is the most powerful punch of all time and is basically like hitting something, or someone, with more force than a meteor. Using his abilities to run at, and sometimes beyond, the speed of light, he is able to also move through time. When combined, this makes The Flash one of the most formidable and dangerous members of the Justice League.</p>
