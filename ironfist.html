							<h2>IRON FIST</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Who is Iron Fist, aside from a guy who’s super good at punching people? Since his debut in 1974, millions of fans have learned the answer to that question. He’s Danny Rand, a martial arts master born into excessive wealth who cleans up the streets of New York, often alongside his friend Luke Cage. But at the same time, yes, he is super good at punching people. Famous for having the exact power you’d expect him to have based on his name, the popular Marvel hero can focus mass amounts of energy into his fist, giving him the ability to superhumanly punch anything and anyone he desires. Essentially, he’s got an Iron Fist and he uses it to take down bad guys. He has enhanced super reflexes. While he can heal others and absorb energy, he is also immune to magic.</p>
