							<h2><center>AQUAMAN</center></h2>
						</header>
						<p>As one of the oldest superheroes in the comic book world and a founding member of the Justice League, Aquaman is one of the most iconic characters in comic book history. Unfortunately, he has spent the bulk of the 75 years of his existence being mocked and ridiculed by comic book readers. Many people consider him to be the weakest among the main Justice League members, though that is certainly not the case.Arthur Curry, AKA Aquaman, is an Atlantean-Human hybrid -- born to a human father and an Atlantean mother. Because of his unique physiology, Aquaman possesses a slew of superpowers, many of which have aided him in his efforts to defend Atlantis as well as fight alongside the Justice League. </p>
						<p>He has night vision and tolerance to intense heat. One of his powers is the ability to summon undead marine life during the Brightest Day crossover event. He can fly and  has the ability of superhuman hearing and sonar. While he can heal people, he can also open portals and control the weather.</p>
