							<h2><center>THOR</center></h2>
						</header>
						<p>Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians, and Jord, who was also known as Gaea, the goddess who was one of the Elder Gods. He is the Asgardian god of thunder and possesses the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him the ability to fly and manipulate weather amongst his other superhuman attributes. </p>
						<p>Thor possesses a very high resistance to physical injury that approaches invulnerability. He has even survived energy blasts from Celestials.Thor possesses keen senses that allow him to track objects traveling faster than light and hear cries from the other side of the planet. Thor has the ability to travel through time. His stamina allowed him to battle the entire Frost Giant army for nine months without any sustenance or rest; Thor has shown the ability to regenerate wounded portions of his body, including entire limbs or organs, with the aid of magical forces such as Mjolnir.Thor has superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes, enabling him to deflect bullets with his hammer,and to swing or throw it at many times the speed of light.In early stories, Thor has shown to be capable of vortex breath, which produces powerful winds.Like all Asgardians, he has immunity to all Earthly diseases and some resistance to magic. Exceptionally powerful magic can overwhelm Odin's enchantment that transforms him between Asgardian and mortal forms.</p>
