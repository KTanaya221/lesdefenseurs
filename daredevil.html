						<p>What Powers Does 'Daredevil' Have? He May Be Blind, But That's The Thing, That Makes Him The Hero He Is. Daredevil's identity in the real world is Matt Murdock, a lawyer living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in New York. When he was younger, he was blinded by a radioactive substance that fell from an oncoming vehicle, and even though he lost his sight, his other four senses were heightened to a superhuman level. His Superhuman Hearing Helps His Act As A Human Lie Detector. He is a martial arts expert. His sense of touch is so strong that he can read words in print, so long as he can touch the ink. He is a pretty badass lawyer.  </p>
